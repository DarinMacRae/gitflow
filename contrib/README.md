Installing on Windows
=====================

After following the basic instruction for cloning...

1. Open a command prompt with Administrative privilege
2. cd into gitflow\contrib
3. ensure that GIT_HOME is pointing to the installation folder of Git (e.g. C:\Users\darin\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\cmd)
4. Run msysgit-install

Note, that it works with installations of Git other than MSysGit.
